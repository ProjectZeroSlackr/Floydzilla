Podzilla v0.1
-------------

Podzilla is a basic GUI for the iPod.  Although it looks like the Apple
version it is actually a re-write and at the moment mostly just a proof
of concept.

!! This version needs the latest kernel available from the ipod sourceforge 
CVS repository. !!

The working parts;
    o Basic menu navigation
    o Settings, Contrast
    o Backlight
    o File Browser
    o Image display (select a .jpg/.gif/.bmp)

Other working parts will be added over time.

Note, the battery display is static!  It does not represent the battery
charge.
