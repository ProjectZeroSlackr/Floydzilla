******** README for nimesweeper v1.0 ********

*********************************************


This will eventually be a proper README file, but for now

it is just a collection of notes.


WHAT IS NIMESWEEPER?

Nimesweeper is a full colour, ncurses based minesweeper clone.


COST?

An Email would be nice (See bottom).


LICENSE?

It may be freely distributed under the terms of the GNU General 

Public License.

(See COPYING)


ON WHICH PLATFORMS WILL IT WORK?

Good question. Well, I know for a fact that it works on an

i686 running Linux with Ncurses-5.2, but as to what else; I have

no idea. It doesn't use any specialised code, it is all ANSI C, so 

I guess it should work on anything that has ncurses, like *BSD

for example. But like I said, I really don't know for sure. You can

always try it out, I would appreciate it if anybody lets me know on

which systems it works on, and which it doesn't.


INSTALLING

No need for ./configure, just "make" and "make install".

"make install" should be done (preferably) as root, but this is

only due to where the default install directories are.

The default directory for the binary is /usr/bin, if you

would rather it somewhere else, edit the "bindir = " value in 

the Makefile to wherever you want it to be installed to.

The default directory for the highscores file is 

/usr/share/nimesweeper, again, if you would rather it somewhere

else, then you will have to edit the Makefile. Change "SourceDir"

(and SourceFile if you wish) to whatever you want.

** NB. Be sure that you the edit the value '#define HIGHSCORES' 

in mine.h to your chosen path if you change either "SourceDir" 

or "SourceFile" in the Makefile. **

( When I get around to it, I will automate all of this... )

The install will prompt you to create a new highscores file, I

recommend saying yes to it. Then all you have to do is maybe 

change the permissions for the highscore directory and file.

And that's it.


UNINSTALLING

Simply "make uninstall".

There is only one binary (nimsweeper), and a highscores directory 

containing one file anyway (/usr/share/nimesweeper/HighScores.dat).


FAQ

1) What is this check.c file for?

It just dumps the contents of the highscores file to the screen,

nothing fancy...

"make check" will build the binary.

2) When I resize the terminal...

It sometimes messes up? Don't resize the terminal. :)

3) What did you use to develop nimesweeper?

nedit / vim

gcc version 2.95.3 (20010315)

Linux kernel 2.4.19 i686

Linux From Scratch 3.3 "distro", if you can call it a distro.

See www.linuxfromscratch.org for more information.

Ncurses-5.2

Glibc-2.2.5

TODO

A proper README and INSTALL file.

Maybe a save game function.

Maybe add mouse support...

Maybe...
